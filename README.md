# **Write a Binomial Class and upload it on PyPi**

## **Probability distributions**

Classes for the following probability distributions:

Binomial distribution

Gaussian distribution

General distribution

## **Project Motivation**

This project (Write a Binomial Class and upload it to PyPi) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I wrote the Binomial Class myself, following the instructions.

## **Libraries**
Python3:

Here are the libraries I used:

numpy

pandas

math

random

matplotlib.pyplot


## **File Descriptions**


package 'prob_distributions' containing: Binomialdistribution.py, Gaussiandistribution.py, Generaldistribution.py, license.txt, setup.cfg


## **Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements**
Must give credit to Udacity for the templates and Gaussiandistribution.py and Generaldistribution.py files.
